## Comments

### Folders

Folders should be well divided, according to the level of security and importance, facilitating the organization of the application.

- *App:*
files that correspond to application logic and database manipulation

- *Js:*
JavaScript files for manipulating the `DOM` and executing asynchronous requests to the application.

- *Public:*
Image files, icons, CSS and general styling.

- *Views:*
General application screens. This folder must contain all pages of the application except `index.php`. This folder should contain other more specialized subfolders for a certain user access level (Example: `Admin`, which encapsulates the pages that the admin should have access to).

### Organization

Use Git and GitHub for organization. It is important that meetings are held and each person is organized according to the project. The project table can be manipulated and used so that each person can take on tasks and take notes on problems encountered.
